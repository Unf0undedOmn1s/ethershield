## Cloud IoT Blockchain Audit | EtherShield by Whiteguard

# History
- Atlanta Airport Ransomware WiFi Attack (https://www.airport-technology.com/features/five-times-airports-were-involved-in-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/)

# Problem
- Intrusion Detection comes in various forms and pass undetected.
- Business’ WiFi’s are the no.1 priority in terms of attacks.
- There's no easy way to detect or track these threats in real-time.

# Solution
- Microcontroller acts as the router
- Identifies suspicious logs based on patterns.
- Sends an alert

# Why now?
- Intrusion Detection is becoming more popular.
- Traditional security systems don’t monitor threats at the physical level in real time.
- Microcontrollers now make it possible to build a scalable intrusion detection system.

# Who we aim to protect:
- Military
- Hospitals
- Universities
- Banks, etc

# Secret Sauce
- Cloud Alert System (FastAPI) | Receives alerts in real-time
- Blockchain Audit & Dashboard | Stores critical events 
- Suspicion Detection Logic | Scoring system/Cloud comparison
